However I saw it happened to other engineers. It make me think that one thing. Most layout related packages are designed with defined style already, but without some function. Then when we use to some project. We may need to use other style to cover it. And write some additional function to make it usable. To some engineers, they have no problem with coding function but style. However to use that kind of layout related packages. It may not be really helpful or efficient to develop front-end. For general case, to customize layout for project is necessary. So why not trying to develop the packages which are designed with generally needed function already and with some very basic style. Then engineers do not need to spend time to cover style and develop function. They can only focus on customize layout style. We let the function to be the black box and we use it like a tool to improve our efficiency of development. That is the meaning to Black Tool Box Laboratory ( BTB Lab. )."]},{"head":"Packages","content":["To the one year of development, I developed 4 packages already:","Actually I have a lot of ideas to my package.

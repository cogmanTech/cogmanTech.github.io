I(No\xebl) took the project of Cloud Network Management System development. Before that, I was a software engineer. Though I developed the web of embedding system product, too. However it developed with jQuery. To the project of CNMS, that is the first time I studied and developed with the React which is the framework of JavaScript. Then I joined to the club of front-end development. And to improve my learning efficiency, I established my own laboratory called black tool box at 11 Nov., 2017. I began to study how to develop components published to NPM as packages for using."]},{"head":"The angle of designing to develop packages","content":["To my self, I have no problem with reproducing the design of layout from draft to style. However I saw it happened to other engineers. It make me think that one thing. Most layout related packages are designed with defined style already, but without some function. Then when we use to some project. We may need to use other style to cover it. And write some additional function to make it usable. To some engineers, they have no problem with coding function but style. However to use that kind of layout related packages. It may not be really helpful or efficient to develop front-end. For general case, to customize layout for project is necessary. So why not trying to develop the packages which are designed with generally needed function already and with some very basic style. Then engineers do not need to spend time to cover style and develop function. They can only focus on customize layout style. We let the function to be the black box and we use it like a tool to improve our efficiency of development. That is the meaning to Black Tool Box Laboratory ( BTB Lab. )."]},{"head":"Products","content":["To the one year of development, I developed 4 packages already:"],"packages":[{"name":"Blacktbox-list","version":"1.2.1","description":"This is my first born child.
